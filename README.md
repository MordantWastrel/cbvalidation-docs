# Introduction

ColdBox sports its own server side validation engine so it can provide you with a unified approach to object and form validation. We have based it on several interfaces, so you can also use any validation framework in your as long as they implement the required interfaces \(See the included API Docs\).

## Introduction

ColdBox validation is based on a way to declaratively specify validation rules for properties or fields in an object or form. The constraints can exist inside of the target object or you can define object and form constraints in your ColdBox [configuration file](http://coldbox.ortusbooks.com/content/configuration/coldboxcfc/index.html) so you can reuse validation constraints or as we call them: **shared constraints**.
